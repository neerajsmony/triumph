        <b>F1 (marketed as F1 the Movie)</b> is a 2025 American sports drama film directed by Joseph Kosinski and written by Ehren Kruger.<br>

        The film stars Brad Pitt as a racing driver who returns to Formula One (F1) after a 30-year absence to save his former teammate's underdog team, APXGP, from collapse. <br>

        Damson Idris, Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies, and Javier Bardem star in supporting roles.<br>


        Development of the film began in December 2021 with Pitt, Kosinski, Kruger, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer attached to the project;
        the latter three had previously worked together on <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gun:_Maverick">Gun: Maverick (2022)</a>.<br>

        Supporting cast members were revealed in early 2023, prior to the start of principal photography at Silverstone that July. <br>

        Filming also took place during Grand Prix weekends of the 2023 and 2024 World Championships, with the collaboration of the FIA, the governing body of F1. <br>

        Racing sequences were adapted from the real-life races, with F1 teams and drivers appearing throughout, including Lewis Hamilton, who was also a producer. <br>

        Hans Zimmer composed the film's score, while numerous artists contributed to its soundtrack.

        F1 premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on June 16, 2025, and was released in the United States by Warner Bros. <br>

        Pictures on June 27. <ins>The film received positive reviews from critics and has grossed over $460 million worldwide against a $200â€“300 million budget</ins>, becoming the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2025.<br>
