        <b><abbr title=" game that is played between two teams of eleven players on a field">Cricket</abbr></b> is a <i>bat-and-ball</i> game that is played between two teams of eleven players on a field,<br>
        at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end,<br>
        each comprising two bails (small sticks) balanced on three stumps.<br>
        <mark>Two players from the batting team</mark>, the striker and nonstriker,<br>
        stand in front of either wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding team, <br>
        the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch.<br>
        The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the<br>
        nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these swaps.<br>
        <ins>Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary of the field or <br>
        when the ball is bowled illegally</ins><br>

1. Pseudo-classes
===============================================
Used to style elements in a specific state.

Common Pseudo-classes:
```````````````````````````````
Selector	    Use Case
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
:hover	        When mouse hovers over the element
:focus	        When input is focused
:nth-child(n)	Targets nth child (e.g., even/odd)

Example:
button:hover {
  background-color: green;
  color: white;
}

input:focus {
  border-color: blue;
}

li:nth-child(odd) {
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
}

2. Pseudo-elements
===============================================
Used to style specific parts of an element.

Common Pseudo-elements:
````````````````````````````````
Selector	Use Case
```````````````````````````````````````````
::before	Insert content before the element
::after	    Insert content after the element

Example: Tooltip using ::after

<button class="tooltip">Hover Me</button>

.tooltip {
  position: relative;
}

.tooltip::after {
  content: "Iâ€™m a tooltip!";
  position: absolute;
  top: 100%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translateX(-50%);
  background: #333;
  color: white;
  padding: 5px;
  font-size: 12px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  white-space: nowrap;
  opacity: 0;
  pointer-events: none;
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
}

.tooltip:hover::after {
  opacity: 1;
}

Additional Practice:
Style every 2nd element: li:nth-child(2n)
Change input border color on focus
Create a button with a label using ::before




1. CSS - Transitions
===============================================
Allow smooth change of CSS properties over time.

Syntax:
button {
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

Property	        Description
````````````````````````````````````````````
property	        What to animate (e.g., color)
duration	        How long (e.g., 0.5s)
timing-function	    Speed curve (ease, linear)

Example:

.btn {
  background-color: teal;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
}

.btn:hover {
  background-color: darkslategray;
}


2. CSS - Animation
===============================================
Define keyframes for step-by-step animations.

Syntax:
@keyframes bounce {
  0%   { transform: translateY(0); }
  50%  { transform: translateY(-20px); }
  100% { transform: translateY(0); }
}

.bouncy {
  animation: bounce 0.5s infinite;
}

Properties:
```````````````````````
animation-name
animation-duration
animation-iteration-count
animation-delay
animation-timing-function

Practice Task: Hover Glow Effect + Bounce Animation
=====================================================

<button class="glow">Hover Me</button>
<div class="bouncy">Bounce Box</div>

.glow {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  background: royalblue;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  transition: box-shadow 0.4s ease;
}
.glow:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px royalblue;
}

@keyframes bounce {
  0%, 100% { transform: translateY(0); }
  50% { transform: translateY(-15px); }
}

.bouncy {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: coral;
  animation: bounce 0.6s ease-in-out infinite;
  margin-top: 20px;
}
