    <!-- Containers are used to pad the content inside of them, and there are two container classes available:
    Fixed Container
    ```````````````````
        width (max-width) will change on different screen sizes:
            Extra small<576px	Small≥576px	Medium≥768px	Large≥992px	Extra Large≥1200px	XXL≥1400px
    max-width:	100%	            540px	    720px	        960px	        1140px	    1320px -->
    <!-- <div class="container">
        <h1>My First Bootstrap Page</h1>
        <p>This part is inside a .container class.</p>
        <p>The .container class provides a responsive fixed width container.</p>
        <p>Resize the browser window to see that the container width will change at different breakpoints.</p>
    </div> -->
    <!-- Fluid Container
     ```````````````````````
        Use the .container-fluid class to create a full width container, 
        that will always span the entire width of the screen (width is always 100%): -->
        <!-- <div class="container-fluid">
            <h1>My First Bootstrap Page</h1>
            <p>This part is inside a .container-fluid class.</p>
            <p>The .container-fluid class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.</p>     
        </div> -->
    <!-- Container Padding
     `````````````````````````
        By default, containers have left and right padding, 
        with no top or bottom padding. Therefore, we often use spacing utilities, 
        such as extra padding and margins to make them look even better. 
        For example, .pt-5 means "add a large top padding": -->
        <!-- <div class="container pt-0">
            <h1>My First Bootstrap Page</h1>
            <p>This container has an extra top padding.</p>
            <p>Try to remove the .pt-5 class to see the difference.</p>
          </div> -->
    <!-- Container Border and Color
     ```````````````````````````````````
        Other utilities, such as borders and colors, 
        are also often used together with containers: -->
        <!-- <div class="container p-5 m-5 border">
            <h1>My First Bootstrap Page</h1>
            <p>This container has a border and some extra padding and margins.</p>
          </div> -->
          
          <div class="container p-5 my-5 bg-dark text-danger">
            <h1>My First Bootstrap Page</h1>
            <p>This container has a dark background color and a white text, and some extra padding and margins.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="container p-5 my-5 bg-primary text-white">
            <h1>My First Bootstrap Page</h1>
            <p>This container has a blue background color and a white text, and some extra padding and margins.</p>
          </div>
    <!-- Responsive Containers
     ```````````````````````````````
        use the .container-sm|md|lg|xl classes to determine 
        when the container should be responsive.
        max-width of the container will change on different screen 
        sizes/viewports: -->
        <div class="container pt-3">
            <h1>Responsive Containers</h1>
            <p>Resize the browser window to see the effect.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container-sm border">.container-sm</div>
        <div class="container-md mt-3 border">.container-md</div>
        <div class="container-lg mt-3 border">.container-lg</div>
        <div class="container-xl mt-3 border">.container-xl</div>
        <div class="container-xxl mt-3 border">.container-xxl</div>
<!--  format {property}{sides}-{size} for xs and {property}{sides}-{breakpoint}-{size} for sm, md, lg, xl, and xxl.

Where property is one of:

m - for classes that set margin
p - for classes that set padding
Where sides is one of:

t - for classes that set margin-top or padding-top
b - for classes that set margin-bottom or padding-bottom
s - (start) for classes that set margin-left or padding-left in LTR, margin-right or padding-right in RTL
e - (end) for classes that set margin-right or padding-right in LTR, margin-left or padding-left in RTL
x - for classes that set both *-left and *-right
y - for classes that set both *-top and *-bottom
blank - for classes that set a margin or padding on all 4 sides of the element
Where size is one of:

0 - for classes that eliminate the margin or padding by setting it to 0
1 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * .25
2 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * .5
3 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer
4 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * 1.5
5 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * 3
auto - for classes that set the margin to auto -->
